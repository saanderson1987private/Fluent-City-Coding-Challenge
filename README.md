#Fluent City Frontend Developer/Designer Challenge

We’d like you to design and implement a button that the user will click to continue through an experience where they are filling out a series of forms (The choice of form we leave up to you). The button starts out in a disabled state, and once the user has supplied the required information, it will be enabled.

Additionally we would like you to place the button in a mobile-friendly HTML page that conforms to the [Official\_FC\_Style\_Guide.pdf]() file we provided. Feel free to be as creative as you like with the surrounding page. Don't worry if you are missing assets like fonts, just draw on the web as a resource to conform to the guide as closely as you can.

##Requirements

**Design:**

- There should be an HTML form (e.g. web login, or whatever you prefer)
- There should be a visible distinction between the button in the ‘disabled’ and ‘enabled’ states that communicates the relevant state to the user.
- There should be a transition/animation when the button goes from ‘disabled’ to ‘enabled’ to call the user’s attention to the fact that they are now able to continue with the experience.
- If the user tries to interact with the button in order to proceed while the button is still disabled, there should be an animation that communicates that they cannot do so. 

**Tech:**

- Use only HTML, SCSS/CSS (SCSS preferred) and JS (libraries permitted but not encouraged)
- Conform to the style guide as best you can
- The pattern you design should be reusable
- Parts of the pattern should also be reusable:
  - Design your code such that if we wanted to use a similar button elsewhere it would be easy to use the same* code, in full or in part, but change the size of the button and the color scheme.
  - Design your code such that if we wanted to use the animation you create for design spec 3 it would be easy to reuse the same* code, in full or in part, elsewhere.

- Bonus points for giving the form error states (but not required)
- Bonus points for using Flexbox (but not required)
  
  *please note that by “same” we mean the actual code, not just a copy-pasted version, in order to maintain a DRY code-base. 

##What we’re looking for:
We’d like to see that you can build reusable components and interactions in SCSS/CSS, and we’d like to see that you have the ability to go beyond styling static elements and use the animation features of css to incorporate usability cues. Feel free to be as creative as you like, but we really want to see a polished design with solid technical implementation as opposed to something incredibly novel or complex.

If you have any additional questions let us know. Happy Coding!
